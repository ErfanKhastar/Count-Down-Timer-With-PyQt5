# ‚è≥ Countdown Timer
A versatile desktop countdown timer application built with Python. It features a settings window to specify the duration and a separate display window with full controls for the countdown. The interface is built with PyQt5, and it uses Pygame for the final sound notification.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Custom Duration:** Set a countdown timer using intuitive dropdowns for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Separate Display Window:** The timer runs in a second, dedicated window, keeping the interface clean.
- **Pause & Resume:** Easily pause and resume the countdown at any time using the "Pause/Resume" button.
- **Reset Functionality:** Reset the timer back to its initial duration with a single click on the "Reset" button.
- **Clear Display:** The remaining time is displayed in a large, easy-to-read `HH:MM:SS` format.
- **Audio & Visual Alerts:**
    - Plays an alarm sound (`alarm.mp3`) when the countdown reaches zero.
    - Shows a pop-up message box to notify you that the time is up.
    - Uses threading for audio playback to ensure the UI remains fully responsive.
